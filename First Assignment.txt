Write a program that print out the numbers from 1 to 100 and show three if the number divided by three
and five if the number divided by 5 and three five if the number divided by both three and five.


I will work on it

#include <iostream>
void main {
for (x=1; x <= 100; x++)
{
    if( x % 3 == 0 )
{
        write("three")
    }
    if( x % 5 == 0 )
{
        write("five")
    }
    if( ( x % 3 != 0 ) && ( x % 5 != 0 ) )
{
        write("three and fivi")
    }
}
