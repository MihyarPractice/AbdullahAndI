Write a program that print out the numbers from 1 to 100 and show three if the number divided by three
and five if the number divided by 5 and three five if the number divided by both three and five.


I will work on it

#include <stdio.h>
int main (void){
int i , j ;
int n==100
if ( i % 3==0)
{
cout<<3<< "i";
}
if (j % 5==0) 
{
cout<<5<< "j";
}
if (i % 3==0 && j % 5==0)
{
cout<< 3 & 5<< "i & j";
}
return 0;}
